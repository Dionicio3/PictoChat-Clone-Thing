This was a test I made for an attempted PictoChat-like Twitch chat thing. Unfortunatly, Python ended up being too slow for what I needed. This repo did include an .NFTR font, but I cannot link to it due to the way I obtained it. I left info about the file here.

NTR_IPL_font_s.NFTR SHA-1 8818EC8D3C6406B170DF19DA1DE2A6D047F4C1D5

Keep in mind the code here is also probably really bad.

Requires ndstextgen, tkinter, PIL

This really sucks, don't use
